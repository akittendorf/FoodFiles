GOAL: COMBINE 4 ordered files into 1 list of dictionaries.

pseudocode:
create empty food list

def open(file):
	use with open...as to open file for reading
		read file as list using .read().splitlines()
	return list

def clean([list]):
	create empty cleaned list
	check for missing data indices (if item in list == \n)
		append to list of indices to remove
	check for corruption indices (if item != yes/no
		append to list of indices to remove
	check for duplication indices (if count(item) > 1)
		append to list of indices to remove
	add good elements to cleaned list
	return cleaned list

def dictionary([list]):
	iterate through list length:
	for index in list length:
		create dictionary with list entries for index
		append dictionary to food list
	return dictionary

def json(dict):
	save complete list of dictionaries as json file with dumps
